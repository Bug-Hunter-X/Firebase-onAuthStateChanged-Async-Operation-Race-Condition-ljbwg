# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Async Operation Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a potential race condition when using Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener with asynchronous operations. The issue arises when the asynchronous operation completes after the component unmounts, causing potential errors.

## Problem

The `onAuthStateChanged` listener is typically used to track changes in the user's authentication state.  However, if you perform an asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data from Firestore) within the listener, there's a risk that the operation might finish after the component has already unmounted. This can lead to unexpected behavior, console warnings, or even memory leaks.

## Solution

The solution involves properly handling the asynchronous operation to ensure it's cancelled or ignored if the component unmounts before completion. This typically involves using a cancellation mechanism (e.g., AbortController) or a flag to check if the component is still mounted before updating state.
